1.  Introduction  
<br>
----------------
<br>
This page is intended as a repository for accumulating some credible information and links as to:
<br>
a) ongoing key deadly disinformation campaigns  active in the US and throughout the world, as of 2021-11-23.
<br>
b) tracing some of the direct and particularly the indirect financing by corporations of those campaigns.  
<br><br>
<br>
It may also develop into a place to review the raw information and bring some order to it and identify which companies seem to be the biggest sponsors of deadly disinformation.  However, it is not clear yet if the resources will be available to make this happen. 

----------------
<br>
2.  Goal and method of achieving that goal:     
<br>
There is no planet on which information should be promulgated that is clearly both wrong and intentionally so, and which ultimately is deadly.  However, the promulgation of such disinformation, and the financing of that promulgation takes place on a basis around the world, and with little comment.  In particular, corporations and individuals financing the flow of disinformation are very brazen about this, as they routinely are able to hide behind the argument that they would not directly finance the disinformation, but that indirect finance is necessary.  They seem to argue that elected officials, news providers and pundits promulgating deadly disinformation are doing so as part of a mixed bag, amidst hundreds of points of accurate information, and the financiers must be allowed to go about the business of sticking up for various causes.  There is no getting away from the inherently sloppy problem, they seem to argue.

We hold on this page that there are some points of disinformation that are so heinous and deadly that their financing should not be tolerated under any circumstances.  This particularly includes that the "indirect and unavoidable" argument does not hold when it comes to these points of disinformation, and that any corporation or ngo or individual financing this disinformation, even indirectly, should be held immediately accountable by consumers and investors.  

It can be argued that issues of deadly disinformation are appropriate also for governments to address, even given concerns around rights of free speech, but that is not the focus of this page.  We are not advocating for censorship.  We are advocating for consumer and investor action.

Our goal is to reduce and stop the flow of deadly disinformation.  How can this be done more effectively by the private sector and without pushing more for government intervention? 
<br>
Our method is: 
<br>
a.  Bring to bear the tools of consumer activism (boycotts and product alternative highlighting, naming and shaming, journalism, reviews, feedback to suppliers), and ESG/Sustainability/related impact equity investing (naming and shaming, shareholder resolutions, dinvestment, feedback to investor relations, fund exclusions and fund investing only in those funds which filter out financers of disinformation).  Use these tools toward corporations which are presently financing deadly disinformation.  The way they finance the disinformation is by
<br> i) advertising on media platforms which clearly choose to carry deadly disinformation,  
<br> ii) donating to disinformation-spreading politicians and groups that send money to those politicians 
<br> iii) donating to think tanks and other organizations which clearly spread disinformation.
<br>
b.  Once the companies are fully responsive and stop all three of these activities, the consumer and impact investing efforts would end toward those companies.
<br>
<br>
c.  Some more detail:
<br>
A main approach to reducing fund flow is to make a list of 
<br>
 - donors to elected officials (including indirect donation such as through a PAC) and 
<br>
 - advertisers on the media organizations (even if the advertising is not directly on shows that spread the disinformation), and then 
<br>
i) encouraging ESG Financial Professionals to modify their filters and credible scoring systems to include examining companies for their disinformation support.  This should particularly include companies which claim support for low-carbon goals, but which then are sloppy in funneling money to deadly climate emergency disinformation (even if indirectly).
<br>

ii) encouraging managers of funds of equities (and other investable products) to use the impact investing tools at their disposal (divestment, shareholder activism, perhaps other tools) to pressure companies to improve their standing with respect to these matters.
<br>
iii) encouraging retail investors and consumers to consider helping shine a light on the bad-actor behavior of some of the otherwise-admirable companies in which they invest, and from which they consume.  This light can be shone by divestment, reduced use of that company's products, and perhaps by other means.

"....Business groups were eager to start giving to Sedition Caucus members in the wake of the January 6th

"The flow of money from corporate PACs and industry groups to political committees allied with the Sedition Caucus started just days after the insurrection, and within the first few months after the deadly attack, their total contributions had already climbed into the millions of dollars.

"....These totals include contributions from PACs that are tied to either a corporation or a business group that represents an industry or profession. The recipients in these tallies include the campaigns and leadership PACs of the 147 members of Congress who voted not to certify the 2020 election results, as well as the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the two main Republican party committees supporting these members.


"While some of the companies that show up in the data aren’t familiar to most Americans — like CSX Corporation and BWX Technologies — a number of the companies, listed in the chart below, are household names that most Americans will `recognize and probably do business with. Several of them initially committed to ceasing contributions to members who voted not to certify the election results,` before deciding to start giving again...."

(note the point on this one is not that there is an issue with Manchin opposing a bill, but that some of the grounds for opposition reminded us that Manchin gets in the way of climate emergency action.  The Republican backer is apparently a co-founder of Home Depot, which is a listed company.  This is a more tenuous suggestion, but noting for raw data for review).

5.  List of deadly disinformation campaigns which are presently the focus of this page (as of November 24, 2021) 
<br>

    a) Climate Emergency
<br>
    
    b) Pandemic Emergency
<br>
    
    c) US 2020 Presidential Election and related ongoing attempts to undermine US Election System Integrity

<br>

----------------
<br>
</ol>

6.  Anticipation of objections/excuses, and rebuttals.
</ol>
<br>
<br>
    i.  The excuse: Most financial support of disinformation campaigns is indirect and watered down.
    <br>
      a) "We cannot help it if donations to politial action committees and politicians go to support many different sorts of votes."
      <br>
      b) "We cannot help it if advertising dollars go to an organization which provides a platform for many different points of view."
    <br>
    <i>Rebuttal</i>:
<br>
This excuse is the primary problem we are trying to counter.    Most of the deadly disinformation is being promulgated two or three levels removed from those helping to finance it.  For example, a company may say that they donate legally to some sort of political group or to a politician who works works to further causes that are in their interest.  They may say that the system is set up in such a way that those groups and politicians may work toward dozens and hundreds of other causes, that there is no way to fight that fact and how can they be expected to avoid all donations which may be tainted in this way.  The answer is that while it is true that the system is set up to co-mingle donations such that many different causes are mixed together, there are some causes that clearly amount to deadly disinformation, and they get people killed and should not be tolerated under any circumstances.   Such causes include disinformation about the climate emergency, about the results of the 2020 US Presidential Election, and about the pandemic.
<br>
<br>
</ol>
       
    ii.  The excuse: You are advocating for "censorship".
</ol><br>
<br>
<i>    Rebuttal </i>
    <br> Censorship (in the common use of the term) is an act of government interference with free speech.  We are not calling for this.  Our call is for consumers and investors to use their rights of free speech (in online comments, in shareholder proposals, and in other ways) along with their rights to behave with freedom as part of the free market (such as in boycott campaigns and in determining which equities to invest in).     
<br>
<br>
</ol>    
iii.  The excuse: "Disinformation" is hard to define.  There is a real risk of discouraging legitimate discussion about hard-to-parse points of science and issues.
</ol>        <br>
   <i>     Rebuttal:</i>
There is a difference between debating extremely hard-to-understand points that are still very much in question, and deliberately putting forth proven-wrong information that will get people killed.  In the case of the climate emergency for example, some aspects of the science are still in doubt, but the basics (that a rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are human-caused, are causing warming, and that the warming is having disastrous consequences) are settled.  If some wish to hold forth otherwise, that is their right, but if a company wishes to be counted as combatting climate change to the best of its ability, then it should be noted and massively discouraged if that company is sponsoring disinformation (even if indirectly) on these points.

Methods for Reducing the flow of finance from financial supporters of disinformation to platformers and spreaders.
<br>

- providing ideas for new Transition and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scoring systems and filters, and similar systems, so that listed companies clearly providing financing in support of disinformation are significantly harmed in their scores and reduced and eliminated from portfolios purporting to carry only companies with decent ESG and Transition scores.
- Divestment
- Continued investment but with sharp engagement (such as Engine No 1 is practicing.... this is a fund with the ticker VOTE that is famous for influencing the Exxon Mobil board).
- product boycotts by consumers.
- general naming and shaming

<br> An Example.

one example came up this year where Toyota was caught financing some politicians opposed election certification.  There was this in late June:

Toyota’s Response on Political Contributions Angers Consumers

06/28/2021
By Nicole Schuman

Toyota issued a statement to Axios acknowledging the donations, but vaguely notes where it draws the line.

and then about 10 days later there was this:

https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-sta … ributions/
Toyota Statement on PAC Contributions
July 08, 2021

Toyota is committed to supporting and promoting actions that further our democracy. Our company has long-standing relationships with Members of Congress across the political spectrum, especially those representing our U.S. operations. Our bipartisan PAC equally supports Democrats and Republicans running for Congress. In fact, in 2021, the vast majority of the contributions went to Democrats and Republicans who supported the certification of the 2020 election. We understand that the PAC decision to support select Members of Congress who contested the results troubled some stakeholders. We are actively listening to our stakeholders and, at this time, we have decided to stop contributing to those Members of Congress who contested the certification of certain states in the 2020 election.


https://www.dallasnews.com/business/loc … ification/
Toyota says it will stop donating to politicians who opposed certification of Biden’s election win
The automaker faced calls for a boycott after a recent watchdog report identified it as the top donor to GOP officials who opposed certifying the 2020 election results.
By Dom DiFurio

1:59 PM on Jul 8, 2021 CDT — Updated at 4:46 PM on Jul 8, 2021 CDT

"...Previously, Toyota had stood behind its corporate PAC donations, saying, “We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification.”..."

So, it just seems to me this is a decent example of bringing about some change in the flow of finance to the spreaders of deadly disinformation
